# üåê Synheart Connectors Program

> _An open initiative to build the world's most transparent and inclusive wellness data ecosystem._

---

## üß† Overview

The **Synheart Connectors Program** invites developers, researchers, and creators to extend the **Synheart Wear SDK** by integrating new **wearables**, **biosignal sensors**, or **behavioral data sources**.

Our mission is to make wellness and affective-computing data open, auditable, and accessible ‚Äî empowering innovation while preserving trust and privacy.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### 1. Fork the Repository

Fork the [synheart-wear repository](https://github.com/synheart-ai/synheart-wear) on GitHub.

### 2. Create Your Adapter Class

Create a new file in `packages/synheart_wear/lib/src/adapters/` named `<device_name>_adapter.dart`:

```dart
import '../core/consent_manager.dart';
import '../core/models.dart';
import 'wear_adapter.dart';

class YourDeviceAdapter implements WearAdapter {
  @override
  String get id => 'your_device';

  @override
  Set<PermissionType> get supportedPermissions => const {
    PermissionType.heartRate,
    PermissionType.steps,
  };

  @override
  Future<void> ensurePermissions() async {
    // Implement device authentication and permission handling
  }

  @override
  Future<WearMetrics?> readSnapshot({bool isRealTime = true}) async {
    // Read and normalize data from your device
  }
}
```

### 3. Implement Required Methods

Your adapter must implement the `WearAdapter` interface with:
- **id**: Unique device identifier
- **supportedPermissions**: Set of biometric data types supported
- **ensurePermissions()**: Handle device authentication
- **readSnapshot()**: Read and normalize device data

### 4. Add Tests

Create a test file `packages/synheart_wear/test/adapters/<device_name>_adapter_test.dart`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:synheart_wear/src/adapters/your_device_adapter.dart';

void main() {
  group('YourDeviceAdapter', () {
    late YourDeviceAdapter adapter;

    setUp(() {
      adapter = YourDeviceAdapter();
    });

    test('id returns correct identifier', () {
      expect(adapter.id, equals('your_device'));
    });

    test('readSnapshot returns WearMetrics', () async {
      final metrics = await adapter.readSnapshot();
      expect(metrics, isA<WearMetrics>());
    });
  });
}
```

### 5. Submit a Pull Request

- Push your changes to your fork
- Open a pull request with a clear description
- Automated checks will validate your implementation
- Community reviewers will test and approve verified connectors

### 6. Celebrate! üéâ

Once merged, your connector appears in the supported devices list and earns community recognition.
